//! The video transformation engine (Plane B) — the sibling of [`ImageProcessor`]
//! for video. It reads the validated source object and produces the adaptive
//! HLS ladder (a master playlist over per-rung media playlists + segments), a still
//! poster, and a BlurHash placeholder, writing every object to the content-
//! addressed store and returning the deliverable renditions.
//!
//! This runs in the dedicated `media-worker` (ffmpeg is CPU-heavy) rather than the
//! request path; the concrete adapter lands in the infrastructure layer.
//!
