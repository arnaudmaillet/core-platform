//! The transformation engine (Plane B). For images-first v1 this derives the
//! resize ladder + a BlurHash from the validated master; the concrete adapter
//! (in-process image library, Phase 4) reads the source object and writes each
//! content-addressed derivative to the store, returning their metadata. Video gets
//! a sibling `Transcoder` port in the fast-follow phase — this trait does not grow
//! a video arm.
