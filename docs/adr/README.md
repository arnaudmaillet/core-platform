# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> An **ADR** captures one architectural decision, the forces behind it, and the alternatives
> rejected — the *why* that code and diagrams cannot express and that otherwise evaporates into
> Slack threads and tribal memory.

## Conventions

- **Format:** MADR-lean — see [`0000-template.md`](./0000-template.md).
- **Naming:** `00NN-<kebab-title>.md`, number zero-padded to 4 digits, monotonically increasing.
- **Immutability:** an Accepted ADR is never edited to change its decision. To reverse it, add a
  **new** ADR that supersedes it and flip the old one's status to `Superseded by ADR-00MM`. The
  preserved trail of superseded decisions is the point.
- **Linkage:** every ADR is referenced from the affected service's `DOMAIN.md §9` (and, for
  cross-context decisions, from `docs/domain/CONTEXT_MAP.md`). Never inline the rationale in those
  docs — link the ADR so the *why* lives in exactly one place.

## Status lifecycle

```
Proposed --> Accepted --> Superseded by ADR-00MM
                      \--> Deprecated
```

<!-- Add one row per ADR as it lands. -->

## Backlog

Every service now has a keystone ADR (0001–0017). The next candidates are the **finer-grained locked
choices** behind them, to be recorded as their own ADRs when next revisited — e.g. audit's
crypto-shred RtbF mechanism, its dual-lane fail-open/fail-closed split, and the hash-chain + WORM +
external-witness immutability scheme; auth's session-`Generation` rotation; profile/social-graph's
author-tier producer flow.
